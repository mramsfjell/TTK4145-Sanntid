    @moduledoc """
    This module is meant to take care of any order not being handled within
    reasonable time, set by the timer length @watchdog_timer.

    A process starts each time an order's watch_node is set up. If the timer
    of a specific order goes out before the order_complete message is received,
    this order is reinjected to the system by the order distribution logic.
    If everything works as expected, the process is killed when the order_complete
    message is received.



    Use genserver whith list of all assigned orders. Use process.send_after to
    take care of expiered timers. Also handle Node down/up
